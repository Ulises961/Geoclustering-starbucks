## Submitting Issues

One way you can help Mock-nextjs is to report bugs or request features on our
GitLab issue trackers. We can't fix problems we don't know about, so please
report early and often!

Before posting your issue, please take a moment to search the tracker's existing
issues first, as it's possible that someone else reported the same issue before
you. Though it helps save time, don't worry! We won't mind if you accidentally
post a duplicate issue.

That's all there is to it! Thanks for posting your issue; we'll take it to heart
and try our best to resolve it.

## Pull Requests

So, you want to write some code? Great!

To begin hacking, fork the repository to your account and `git clone` the forked
copy to your local machine. On clone you will be on the *master* branch. This
is the branch that contains all new work that has not been released yet. If you
are adding a new feature to Mock-nextjs then you want to base your work off of this
branch. Otherwise, if you are attemping to fix something in an older release you
will have to base your work off of a released tag. This can be done after a clone
by running `git checkout TAG` where `TAG` is a released tag eg `v0.8.0`. Now that
you have the latest code you can start contributing.

## Writing Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! A solid project needs to have
solid documentation to go with it. You can search for documentation-related
issues on any of our GitLab trackers by filtering by the documentation label.
